This is the repository containing the code that was used to find the Optic Discs from retina images and crop them, to augment the cropped images, and to train our model.
The preprocess.py file contains the code for the data augmentation.
The OD_detector.ipynb contains the code for detecting and cropping the Optic Discs.
The rest of the code is used for training the DeIT classifier.
